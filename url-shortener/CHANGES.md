# AI Usage Disclosure
## Tools used:

### Perplexity AI (large language model/API)

### What I used them for:

- Drafting the initial project structure (separate modules for main app, models, utilities, and tests).
- Helping define core logic for the Flask API endpoints.
- Generating boilerplate code for thread-safe in-memory storage and URL validation.
- Drafting unit and integration tests based on project requirements.
- Occasionally requesting examples for error handling and test coverage patterns.

### Edits, Additions, and Overwrites:

- I reviewed, adapted, and sometimes rewrote AI-generated code to ensure:
- Alignment with the projectâ€™s functional and technical requirements.
- Code clarity and consistent module structure.
- Robust error handling, isolation of test cases, and Pythonic style.
- All test cases were manually checked and modified so that they pass reliably and cover the required scenarios.
- Utility functions and storage locking were double-checked and, where necessary, improved to avoid concurrency bugs.

### What I rejected:

- Any AI suggestions proposing custom user authentication, persistent databases, web UIs, or features not in scope for this assessment.
- Overly complex or unnecessary abstractions.
